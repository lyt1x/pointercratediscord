## History
  This is a bot I began coding in late 2021 for a private Russian server that had around 150 members at the time. After I implemented a few commands, people started showing interest in the bot, which motivated me to add more and more features. By 2022, the bot was being used daily by over 10 people. In 2023, I created a public Discord server and translated the bot into English, the server gained approximately 80 members. Around Sep 2023 my Discord account got banned, and I didn't really update the code in months so I just stopped hosting the bot.

  ⚠️ If you want to use this as a base for your own bot, please note that a few commands may not work today, and some were implemented in a way that could be significantly improved using the full V2 API instead of V1.
